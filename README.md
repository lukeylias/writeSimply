writeSimply is a minimal desktop app where you can write freely, no subscriptions, no clutter, just pure writing
I know there are many writing apps out there, but I wanted to make my own, so I built this one
If you like simple tools or want to learn Tauri, you might enjoy it too

Features
- Distraction free writing
- Font and size customization
- Simple timer for writing sessions
- Works offline
- Music Player
- Open source and beginner-friendly
